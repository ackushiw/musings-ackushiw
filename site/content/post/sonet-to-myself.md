Forbidden love where canst thou go this hour?

Thou art a lost white wand'rer seeking love;

Like a new budding rose that strives to flower

Amid the harsh cold wind from storms above.

Will not thou bloom in thine own fiery glow?

Or wil't thou drown thyself in Agony;

As like to falling flakes of fresh soft snow,

Sad, melts its figure in a troubled sea.

What will you do with this wild rose that germs,

Will you attend its silent deep desires,

Or leave neglected all alone, who yearns

Forlorn among the weeds and there expires.

My rash forbidden love may blinded be,

But I myself determined am to see.
