I do remember that you were once kind,

But the mists roll in and cloud the mind,

And shrouding what was once so clear

Till forms of beauty all but disappear.

<div class="break">

I rip ope my soul for all to see

Yet all are blind to my agony.

I stumble on in darkness bound

None but echoes do hear my sound.

<div class="break">

I call on names to help my plight

But it is my own mind that I do fight

It grips me in its cold embrace

Dragging me down to a darker place.

<div class="break">

Here I stand naked in despair

Knowing that none could ever care.

So I lament at my own tragedy

Cursing the fool who believed in destiny.

<div class="break">

<div class="break">

Soaring high above light and free,

A swallow playing calls to me,

What wise words I do not know,

But with his fair song my heart does flow.

<div class="break">

Here below on the ground I stand,

Gazing up I reach out my hand,

Above he flies beautifully fast,

My heart skips a beat and is free at last.
