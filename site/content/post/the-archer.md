**The arrow flies fast**

But never straight

Weaving its way

Along your intension

The bow is your body

The arrow your mind

Let your soul's focus flow

With every mark you see

You loose an arrow free

And every mark you show

Is a place you can go.

These marks are for you

That you may focus true.
