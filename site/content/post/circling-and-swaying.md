A mass of over zealous men circling a pair of swaying girls drowning in a sea of sweat and testosterone. Amid the stench of these bullish vultures they dance alone. Alone shuffling clumsily on the alcohol soaked floor buffeted between the over-proteined arms and under exercised bellies. Eyes blank and lips red. The regression of man. And I watch on mesmerized by the sickening vision of the devolution before my eyes, scavenged lust, torpid love, and so I drink up to cover the smell and slip out unseen, unnoticed, an extinct creature forgotten through time.
