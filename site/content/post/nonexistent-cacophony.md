The saponification of creamed custard

<div class=break></div>

Is the pacification of rhubarb

<div class=break></div>

As the dickey bird sings and nuzzles its wings and credit cards fly off bookshelves and bastards cry themselves to sleep.

<div class=break></div>

Black sheep, red sheep no sleep no sheep.

<div class=break></div>

Walls of toothpaste mortar and crushed glass.

<div class=break></div>

A see-through shield to block the sun.

<div class=break></div>

And the ammunition rains on. On and on.

<div class=break></div>

Blasts of wool, red and black destroying time. A cacophony of phony people pleasing dogs and as they run circles round and round.

<div class=break></div>

Birdsong, moon-song and the mooing of cows. It will rain today. Where is my weather man, bring me my umbrella, unbreakable thoughts shattering my bones. My body bursts with the boom of unquenchable dreams. Unquestioned doctors drill on. March march march. You sorry sons of bitches. For you are sick and have no time. Go fight for life and freedom forever fix your gaze on grace.

<div class=break></div>

A hazy landscape of sun soaked hills and mists rise from dew drenched grasses. A new morning. The grass laments and tears drip from trees and sigh a breath spreading out on the ocean of life. Can you see it. life?

<div class=break></div>

Touch it, smell it, taste it? Love it?

<div class=break></div>

Order emerges from chaotic ramblings and sink back again in to a sea of purple silk, streaming through dead men's dreams, lofty castles built on time. Globs of the stuff, sticky and sour drip through the halls of kings. Play your cards right. You will go far. Execute. An action of forbearance. Swiftly swiftly my dear, your action means nothing without focus. Folds of laundered sheep singing fluffy freedom. Pattering of cow patted grass greener than the rest. Taller stronger thicker. Oh mighty oak sway this ballad for me. A thousand suns and moons have danced for you, rains and mists have washed you clean. Bow for me and whisper my name for I have lost it in the backseat of a taxi, the company told me I am mad. But I am just alone. No company of ghosts for me, they know not my name. Come play cards with me. They say ace of clubs is high and mighty, but I'll sit on my jack and part with my name on spades. Resume.

<div class=break></div>

Exhume. I've buried my name amid dust and receipts. Give me no flowers, show me no tears and I'll drift on and drink my coffee. My stomach complains about the weather. Ha. What idle chit chat. Go digest some beans and bloviate no more my forgetful friend. Sleep is good, but bed is better, I see you're a betting man, but I am a fool so cannot lose. Jack of spades. Pink blossoms in winter, an unusual sight. Prick up your ears, pick up your bow of horn and hide. Amongst trees, of wolf. It is cold in the snow but bare your teeth and wait. Pretensions of patience is all you need now. Silence. Still. Enough.
