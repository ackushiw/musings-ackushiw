What is the point. Creativity. How do I live a life full to the brim with creation and creating. What if at every point of every minute of every day I was creating; creating dreams at night, creating sustenance during the day. Using my body, my mind and every aspect of myself both physical and non-physical to create something new, or maybe old, every moment of every day? Imagine what a life it would be! Imagine that in every moment of every day you give yourself fully to those around you and yourself. And know that it is only yourself that prevents you from doing this.

To create is a natural ability. A common right, and environments that encourage it flourish, and those that don’t fall away in decay. It being natural to us we shouldn’t have to force creation but we should find joy in the creativity. Creation comes from us spontaneously. Imagine everything we dream up comes to the physical world flowing easily through us. What kind of dreams have you? What kind of dreams do you want to create? Dreaming is not a passive state of being, it is action. An act of creation. Resist your dreams at your peril. Live them if you dare.
