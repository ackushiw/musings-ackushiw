Celebrate the beauty of the female

As an artist would with the curve of a brushstroke

Dancing in the leaf filled wind.

Twirl with the leaves like a swallow playing

And beyond all this flies into the clear morning sky.

A blue sky flecked with floating sun lit leaves

Lazily whispering the Winter's song in the Autumn wind.

A cold wind whining. A warm breath breathing.

Love her like the swallow loves the air

As the sky sings through his feathers,

Humming, winging, soaring free

Fast and light over the fields and trees

Dancing fast through the fickle air.

Darting and playing, flitting and swaying

The eternal caress of the heavens with his wing tips.

He is an artist flickering and flirting

With the swirls and soft molding forms of the liquid sky.

A beautiful blue sky -- cold and clear.
